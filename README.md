#This project is on a store data
-----------------------------------------
I obtained the data from Google, began by cleaning it, sorting and filtering it based on the requirement for insight, then used Power Query to trim and format the data, then used pivot to get a reference with the sales and profit, then used chart for better visuality, and last developed a dashboard.

Tools used: Microsoft Excel.
